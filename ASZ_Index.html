					It is my mission to make food an enjoyable part of your life, as it is such an important part of mine. I believe:
				</p>

				<h2 class="quote">
					“It’s not about what you can’t eat, it’s about what you <span>can</span> eat.”
				</h2>

				<p>
					For me, no food needs to be off-limits. I help to adapt recipes to your own personal needs, while also facilitating menu planning for your everyday life. 
				</p>
				
				<p>	
					But unlike many in the nutrition field, I love to cook! By working with me, YOU will learn how to make great-tasting dishes. Whether we go grocery shopping together or work side-by-side in the kitchen, I am here to teach you how to live the nutritious lifestyle that is best for you. 
				</p>
				
				<p>		
					I am here to help make food fun again and I can customize a program that best fits your needs, as no diet is one-size-fits all.

						About Allie
					</h3>

					<p>
						Food always brought my family together, just like it does for many of you. I learned basic cooking skills by helping my mom make dinner for us every night. My interest for nutrition and healthy living was prompted at an early age over several family health concerns. I became a Registered Dietitian and began practicing in the field. This is when I found my passion in cooking and finding different ways to incorporate delicious food into a healthy diet. 
					</p>

					<p>
						My knowledge and interest further grew while working as an Editor and Registered Dietitian overseeing several cookbook and cooking magazine projects under the healthy living category. These included diabetic, diet, and gluten-free recipes. I had the wonderful and unique job of developing and testing new recipes, conducting nutritional analyses on recipes, and modifying them as necessary. The kitchen became my playground.
					</p>

					<p>
						My experience also includes working in diverse settings throughout the Chicagoland area, particularly schools, rural communities, supermarkets, corporate businesses, and healthcare facilities. I also have an extensive background in developing and using food service nutritional analysis databases.
					</p>

					<p id="last">
						I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Food Science and Human Nutrition with a concentration in Dietetics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I completed my Dietetic Internship at Loyola University Chicago School of Nursing with a focus on Community and Clinical Nutrition.
